            Mascots are believed to bring good luck, especially to athletic teams.<br>
             Just about every college claims a mascot.
             The University of Kansas is home of the Jayhawk,</br> a mythical bird with a fascinating history.
              Its origin is rooted in the historic struggles of Kansas settlers.
              <br>The term "Jayhawk" was probably coined about 1848.
               Accounts of its use appeared from Illinois to Texas.</br>
                The name combines two birds--the blue jay, a noisy, quarrelsome thing known to rob other nests,
                 and the </br>sparrow hawk, a stealthy hunter. <br>The message here: Don't turn your back on this bird.</br>
