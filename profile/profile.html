            <p>
                Bigfoot also known as Sasquatch is an ape-like creature commonly found in forests across
                North America. He is very large with a height of 10 feet and weighs about 500 pounds.
                He has a huge footprint that is about 2 feet long and has a very hairy body. He is known to be smarter
                than other apes managing to elude capture. Thus, there are no bigfoots in any zoo in any part of the world.
                 Due to his elusive nature, no significant observation of their behavior or social structure has been
                 made. Thus, he still remains a mystery.
