            <p>
                Bigfoot also known as Sasquatch is an ape-like creature commonly found in forests across
                North America.<br> He is very large with a height of 10 feet and weighs about 500 pounds.</br>
                He has a huge footprint that is about 2 feet long and has a very hairy body.<br>He is known to be smarter
                than other apes managing to elude capture.</br>Thus, there are no bigfoots in any zoo in any part of the
                world.<br>Due to his elusive nature, no significant observation of their behavior or social structure has been
                 made.</br> Thus, he still remains a mystery.
